# Number of zeroes in a 3 bit input

This code counts the number of zeroes in a 3 bit binary input. 
Example:  Zero in 3 bit binary is represented as 000. The number of zeroes in the input is 3. The output will be 11 as, 3 in binary is 11.
The output will be displayed as follows:

0 0 0 : 1 1  
0 0 1 : 1 0  
0 1 0 : 1 0  
0 1 1 : 0 1  
1 0 0 : 1 0  
1 0 1 : 0 1  
1 1 0 : 0 1  
1 1 1 : 0 0
